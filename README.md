Welcome to the `core-java` branch of BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training repository!  
This branch focuses on foundational Java concepts through structured practice programs and examples.

This branch is divided into the following key areas:
1. Programming Elements
Basic building blocks of Java:
- Variables and data types
- Input/output
- Operators and expressions

2. Control Flow
Understand how decisions and loops work:
- If, else-if, and switch statements
- For, while, and do-while loops
- Nested loops and break/continue usage

 3. Array Practices
 Work with single and multi-dimensional arrays:
 - Array initialization and traversal
 - Sorting and searching
 - Frequency and duplicate detection

 4.  Java Methods
 Learn modular programming with:
- Method declaration and calling
- Return types and parameters
- Method overloading and scope

 5. Java Strings
String manipulation and operations:
- String creation and comparison
- Common methods (`length()`, `substring()`, `equals()`, etc.)
- StringBuilder usage for performance
